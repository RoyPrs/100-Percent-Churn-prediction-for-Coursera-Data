After I finished "Machine Learning Specialization" thought by Andrew NG., I recieved an email from Coursera to participate in a challenge. The challenge was using my machine learning skills to predict retention for Coursera learners.
I accepted the challenge. I had only 12 hours to finish the challenge. At that time, I cleaned the data and created the machine learning model.
My model worked and I got the certificate which you can find in this repository.
Later on, I decided to explore the data more extensively and practice my skills with this priceless data.
